# NAI_Huffman
## MY solution to constructing a huffman code/tree out of string of symbols:
Write implementation of algorithm that creates Huffman tree and can encode and decode the sequence. Create Huffman tree using your own implementation of priority queue. Priority queue has to be written from scratch but you can choose implementation: naive, binary search tree etc.


Input is alphanumerical sequence. As a result, print Huffman code for all symbols in an input sequence and encoded input sequence.


Optional: create graphical representation of Huffman tree.
